# Challenges & Reflections
- Organizing the project was difficult. Having to use multiple files and ensuring everything was connected and working properly 
- I learned its important to test errors and make sure they arent crashing the app
- Connecting the project to Git hub was odd. I had never done anything like this before. 
- It was fun trying to make the app run as similar to a real life scenario as possible
